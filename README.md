## 📚 What I learned

This project helped me improve my **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** skills.  
I also learned how to structure reusable **utility classes** and handle responsive layouts effectively.

Here’s a small code snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.cards-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  margin-top: 40px;
}
